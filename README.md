# Implementation of GA to develop simple linear regression model

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to develop a simple linear regression model. Genetic Algorithms are optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection, and they can be applied to find optimal parameters for regression models.

In this project, we utilize a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of coefficients for a simple linear regression equation. The goal is to showcase how GA can be employed as an alternative optimization method for linear regression tasks.
